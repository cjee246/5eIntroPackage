# 5eIntroPackage
A package of documents to help onboard new players/DMs to 5e. Includes the following:

- A condensed rulebook with a 30-minute walkthrough
- 50 premade character sheets with randomization tables
    - Characters are roughly balanced at level 3 in a normal game
- A silly, cozy one-shot adventure
    - The adventure also has an example of my DM Assistant (https://github.com/cjee246/5eDmAssistant)

Note that preparation work is still recommended. Read through the adventure beforehand and try to suggest characters to your players (character selection can be a huge timesink if left uncontrolled). Read through the instructions beforehand and envision yourself walking your group through them. 

A the end of the day, this is all about hanging out with your friends. So no worries, best of luck, and happy RPGing!
